##256color.pl
Not shown in image, makes a simple 256 color rectangle to test if terminals have 256 color compatibility.

Middle-left in image, a bash script I made when bored, might not always get IP addresses right, otherwise it should work for everything else.

##hackertyper.sh
Not shown in image, a shell script made to mimic [Hacker Typer](http://hackertyper.com/)

##pipes.sh
Top-Right in image, makes pipes. If I recall correctly it was a pretty old script, but it didn't work, someone had posted it on 4chan and I fixed it.
